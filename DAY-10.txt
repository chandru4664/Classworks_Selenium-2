
Connection pooling

Connection pooling is a mechanism to create and maintain a collection of JDBC connection objects. 
The primary objective of maintaining the pool of connection object is to leverage re-usability and improve the overall performance of the application.

1. Introduction
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a  wide range of databases.
The JDBC library includes API for each of the tasks commonly associated with the database usage:
Making a connection to the database.
Creating SQL statements.
Executing SQL queries in the database.
Viewing and Modifying the resulting records.


JNDI
The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is an application programming interface (API) for accessing different kinds of naming and directory services.
 JNDI is not specific to a particular naming or directory service, it can be used to access many different kinds of systems including file systems; distributed objects systems like CORBA, Java RMI, and EJB; and directory services like LDAP, Novell NetWare, and NIS+.
JNDI is similar to JDBC in that they are both Object-Oriented Java APIs that provide a common abstraction for accessing services from different vendors. 
While JDBC can be used to access a variety of relational databases, JNDI can be used to access a variety of of naming and directory services.
